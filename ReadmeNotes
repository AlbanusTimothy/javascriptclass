**INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPY**
--basic building blocks of the web:
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.JS--defines the behaviour of a webpage

**JS is a high level interpreted language used to make web pages interactive or dynamic
--->it runs directly in your browser
--->JS does the following
1.user interactivity--ability of the webpage to respond to user action e.g. button clicks,animations,form inputs
2.Reactivity

Writing JS
1.Internal JS--a script in a HTML file
   (i) script in the body section- right above the closing body tag(the recomended way)
   (ii) a script in the head section
2.External JS-----The best way
------create an external JS file with a .js extension and then limk to a html file using a source(src) attribute   

**VARIABLES**
A variable is a named container or memory space used to store values
--->ways of declaring variables in JS
1. using the let keyword
---most common way of declaring avariable
---variables declared using let can be re assigned meaning values can be changed
eg--- let x = 5// declaration
x = 10 reassigned//
2. using const keyword
---variables once declared cant be reasigned or changed in value
eg const name = "jane"--> this cant be changed
3. using the var keyword
---works just like let but its outdated it works in older browsers

JS DATATYPES
1.string-- represents textual data or charachters enclosed in quotation marks
2.Number--numeric values-- both whole numbers and decimal numbers
3.boolean--represents truth values -- true and false


How to output in JS...
console.log()
checking type of data = typeof()

**STRING METHODS & OPERATIONS**

- Methods are inbuilt functions used to manipulate data

1. Concatenation – joining or combining strings
    a) Using "+" operator
    b) using concat() method
2. Template literals - a way of embedding or including variables inside strings
     -we use: backticks,dollar signs and curly braces   
3. Accessing charachters in a string- strings are ordered--use indexing
      n/b:-in accessing string charachters in JS, we dont have negative indexes 
4.determining no of charachters in a string-- we use .length   
5. .slice() returns a portion/ substring of a full string syntax=console.log(text.slice(0,4))
--slicing accepts negative index but it picks and moves forward not backwards
6. .toUppercase()--converts a string to uppercase format
7. .toLowercase()---converts a string to lowercase format
8. .includes()--checks whether a string has a specified charachters or substring--- and it returns a boolean
9. .startsWith()--checks whether a string starts with a specific char or substring they return boolean together with ends with
10. .endsWith() checks whether a string ends with a specific char or substring
11. .indexOf()---returns the first occurence of a specified charachter
12. .replace()---replaces specified charachter/s with an ew one
13. .trim()--removes all wide spaces around values  

**Numeric Operations**
1. addition
2. subtraction
3. division
4. multiplication- *
6. exponent- **
7. modulus - %
8. incriment operator ++
9. decrement operator --
10. .toString()- converts a number to a string
11. toFixed()- rounds off a number to specified decimal spaces
12. math.round()-- rounds a number to the nearest integer
13. math.floor-- rounds down
14. math.ceil---rounds up

                        **LESSON 2**
**User Input**
-Makes programs interactive and dynamic
-In JS we take user input using prompt()
-Any data coming from user input is always a string
**Changing Data Type**
**String -> Number
**Number -> String
**Boolean conversions

1.Type conversion -> manual changing of data from one type to another
                -> explicitly done by the programmer
        **Convert string to number**
        a)Number() - convert string to number
        b)parseInt() - convert string to integer
        c)parseFloat() -convert string to decimal number

        **Convert number to string**
        a) String()
        b).toString()

2.Type coercion - where data is automatically changed from one type to another by 
                the language / interpreter 
                -> not changed by the programmer
        -> Polymorphism -> operator overloading -> an operator takes more than one form
        + -> concat -> addition

**JS OPERATORS**
-> Operators are symbols used to perfom specific tasks
-> We have 4 categories of operators:
1.Arithmetic Operators -numeric operations
-> + (addition)
-> - (subtract)
-> / (divide)
-> * (multiply)
-> ** (exponential)
-> % (modulus)
-> ++(increment) - increases by 1
-> --(decrement) - decreases by 1

2.Comparison Operators -compares values
-> == (loose equality) -> type coercion happens -> checks only for the value not data type
-> ===(strict equality) -> no type coercion -> checks for both value and data type
-> != (loose inequality)
-> !==(strict inequality)
-> > (greater than)
-> < (less than)
-> >= (greater than or equal to)
-> <= (less than or equal to)

3.Logical Operators - logical operations
-> Logical and - && ->  returns true only if both conditions are true
-> Logical or -> || -> returns true if t least on condition is true
-> Logical not -> ! - returns the opposite of a Boolean value


4.Assignment Operators - assigns values
-> = (assign)
-> += (add and assign)
-> -= (subtract nd assign)
-> *= (multiply and assign)
-> /= (divide and assign)
-> **= (raise to a number and assign)
-> %= (get remainder and assign)


**Task**
1.Find out what the 'in' operator does and illustrate with Javascript code - use w3schools or geeksforgeeks as references
2. Write a program that takes 2 numeric user inputs and outputs the following:
  -> their sum
  -> their subtraction
  -> their modulus
  -> their exponent

**CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS**
Enables a program to make decisions based on inputs
** Types of conditional statements**
-> if else ->
->if ,else if,else
->conditional expretions-->ternary operator

general syntax:
{}-->represents a block of code
scenario one--** one condition to be met** eg checking whether a number is even or not
if (condition){
    //what happens if condition is met

}else{
    //what happens when the condition is false
}

scenario two--** multiple conditions**eg checking students grades
if (condition 1){
    //what happens if condition 1 is true
}
else if (condition 2){
    //what happens if condition 2 is true
}
else if( condition 3){
    //what happens if condition 3 is true
}else{
    //what happens when all conditions are false
}
        in class task
1. write a js program that checks if a number is even or odd
2. write a js programm that displays the largest interger among three intergers
--> for each of the tasks take user input        

**Ternary operator**
-> ?
-> it is the shorthand of if else statements
->it works with only one condtion
-> the syntax
        condition ? what happens if true: what happens if false
             task
q. using ternary operator check if a person is eligible to vote.--> anyone voting has to be 18 years and older





**JS DATA STRUCTURES**
we use d/ss to store multiple values in variables
1. Arrays
2. Objects
         **JS ARRAYS**
A data structure used to hold multiple values in an ordered manner
represented using []
->equvalent of lists in python  
**properties**
1.they are ordered--indexing
  n/b no negative indexing in js arrays
2.mutable--values can be changed
3.can contain multiple values of any type 
        **array operation**
1.creating an array   
2.accessing values in an array-use indexing and its zero based  
3.updating values in an array
--->we can use index 
4.determining number of values in an array-->we use the length feature
5.adding items to an array
  a).add at the end--> we use .push()
  b).add at the beginning--we use .unshift()
6.removing items from an array
a).remove the first item-->we use shift()
b).remove the last item-->we use pop 

           **OBJECTS***
Object are data strucures that store data in key-value pairs
-> they are the equivalent of python dictionaries
     **properties of objects**
1. store data in key-value pairs
2. they use keys to access values
3. keys are unique
4. keys have to e strings
5. values can be of any data type
->objects are represented using {}
**properties**->this is the cmbination of keys and values  
properties are comma separated              
property=key + value

**object operations**
1. creating an object
2. accessing values in an object
     a).Dot notation
     ->use the dot operator followed by the key
     ->can only be used with keys that follow identifier(variables) naming rules
     ->dot notaton cant work for keys with spaces
     b).bracket notaion
     ->uses square brackets taking keys as strings ["key]
     ->can accept keys with spaces



**object methods**
